# Social-Media-Analytics: Reddit Analysis
This project aims to analyze the subreddit r/seduction, which is a forum for discussing and sharing tips on how to attract and pick up romantic partners. The subreddit has faced controversy in the past for promoting toxic and manipulative behavior, as well as objectifying and devaluing women. The main objective of the project is to gain a better understanding of the current community and detect whether it is negative or not, to extract the interactions between users, detect communities, interests and the most discussed topics. Data of posts and comments were collected for the month of October 2022 and analyzed using sentiment analysis, network modeling and topic modeling. The results show that the subreddit has a positive sentiment overall, and the most discussed topics are related to appearance, approaches to women, relationships, and sexual relations. The project suggests that further research could be done by analyzing more data collected over a larger period of time, in order to gain a more reliable and relevant understanding of the r/seduction community as it is today.
