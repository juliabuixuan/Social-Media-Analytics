He believes that no woman will leave for college if she dating a man she’s in love with. \\n\\nI had a girlfriend who I met over the summer before her sophomore year. She went to a university out of state. We got into a relationship right before she left. Things were hard that first year but we got through it. My older brother was a new corporate lawyer making 6 figures and I would borrow money to go see her twice that year. The other times I would see her during winter and spring break when she came down. The longer we were together the more serious things became. She started to talk about us being together for a long time. She would send me engagement rings etc. \\n\\nShe came home for the summer before her junior year and things were great, but they started to go downhill once she went back to school. She became attached. And wanted me to visit her once a month. I worked remote so she didn’t see it as a big deal. But I had recently cofounded an excavation company in our hometown. It required a lot of time. At first I saw the distance as a good thing. I wouldn’t be distracted. But I became more and more sexually frustrated and starved of intimacy as the weeks went on. She missed me more as well. \\n\\nI expressed to her my frustrations. She became more and more worried that I’d cheat on her or breakup with her. I told her she could transfer to a state school in our home state. She didn’t seem interested.  Instead, she INSISTED that I come see her. I gave in and saw her for a week and a half while my friend ran the business. I spent over $1000 on that trip. I told her I couldn’t come see her anymore and that I’d see her when she was home for break. She would then continue to still ask me if I could come see her again. I told her no this time and that we would see each other when we happened to be in the same state. \\n\\nShe told me time and time again how she was looking to transfer and move back home. It never happened. I eventually broke things off with her as I felt the relationship was becoming one sided. She begged and begged but I wasn’t willing to put my life aside anymore to see her if she wasn’t going to at least try to look into transferring. \\n\\nWhen I told this story to a few of my guys, one individual revealed to me that if a woman is really into a man she will do whatever is in her power to close the distance; that her leaving to college the first year we met was to be expected, however anything after that and she wasn’t as in love as you or she thought she was. This was a slight blow to my ego no lie. \\n\\nWe would end up linking up twice after she graduated by I ended up moving states. I’m 28 now. Thoughts? \\n\\nTLDR; Do you think any woman who is willing to continuously go back to college (when she has other alternatives) and be in a long distance relationship with a man is not truly in love with him?   \n","1342  This is a RANT...\\n\\nI've been on this sub for ages (on and off). One trend that concerns is that almost everyday I see a question \"how do I approach this girl in my building/work/work\"? They all follow the same pattern.\\n\\nNoob to seduction -- wants to talk to this one girl he is crushing over.\\n\\nMaybe, because I am older. But I am starting to find this whole thing annoying.\\n\\nInstead of asking us \"how\" or \"when\" to approach (BTW the responses/comments are usually the same\" -- give us a report or story on how the approach went. \\n\\nWe all get rejected. Or sometimes we become successful and we share our days. You are not the only one. \\n\\nSo, for crying out loud -- don't post questions asking how to approach one girl that you want to talk to?\\n\\nInstead, tell us how you approached, and how it went...\\n\\nRANT over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n","1344  This has happened like 3 times already.

He believes that no woman will leave for college if she dating a man she’s in love with. \\n\\nI had a girlfriend who I met over the summer before her sophomore year. She went to a university out of state. We got into a relationship right before she left. Things were hard that first year but we got through it. My older brother was a new corporate lawyer making 6 figures and I would borrow money to go see her twice that year. The other times I would see her during winter and spring break when she came down. The longer we were together the more serious things became. She started to talk about us being together for a long time. She would send me engagement rings etc. \\n\\nShe came home for the summer before her junior year and things were great, but they started to go downhill once she went back to school. She became attached. And wanted me to visit her once a month. I worked remote so she didn’t see it as a big deal. But I had recently cofounded an excavation company in our hometown. It required a lot of time. At first I saw the distance as a good thing. I wouldn’t be distracted. But I became more and more sexually frustrated and starved of intimacy as the weeks went on. She missed me more as well. \\n\\nI expressed to her my frustrations. She became more and more worried that I’d cheat on her or breakup with her. I told her she could transfer to a state school in our home state. She didn’t seem interested.  Instead, she INSISTED that I come see her. I gave in and saw her for a week and a half while my friend ran the business. I spent over $1000 on that trip. I told her I couldn’t come see her anymore and that I’d see her when she was home for break. She would then continue to still ask me if I could come see her again. I told her no this time and that we would see each other when we happened to be in the same state. \\n\\nShe told me time and time again how she was looking to transfer and move back home. It never happened. I eventually broke things off with her as I felt the relationship was becoming one sided. She begged and begged but I wasn’t willing to put my life aside anymore to see her if she wasn’t going to at least try to look into transferring. \\n\\nWhen I told this story to a few of my guys, one individual revealed to me that if a woman is really into a man she will do whatever is in her power to close the distance; that her leaving to college the first year we met was to be expected, however anything after that and she wasn’t as in love as you or she thought she was. This was a slight blow to my ego no lie. \\n\\nWe would end up linking up twice after she graduated by I ended up moving states. I’m 28 now. Thoughts? \\n\\nTLDR; Do you think any woman who is willing to continuously go back to college (when she has other alternatives) and be in a long distance relationship with a man is not truly in love with him?</td>\n","      <td>KingsVictory19</td>\n","      <td>yiqedj</td>\n","      <td>2022-10-31 22:05:37</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yiqedj/do_you_believe_a_girl_who_is_willing_to_leave_her/</td>\n","      <td>1.00</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1342</th>\n","      <td>Request to MODS &amp;amp; Community --- Can we please stop with \"how do I talk to this girl in my ....\" questions</td>\n","      <td>This is a RANT...\\n\\nI've been on this sub for ages (on and off).

secret, women are very wary of strangers. With OLD quickly losing its luster- IRL is the best way to meet new women. Building rapport is key to have a girl open up and actually have a conversation to progress into hanging out, dating, etc. Sometimes I'm at a loss when the girl is clearly interested, but the progression to introduction to dating stumbles. As an acceptability attractive man, I get plenty of IOIs and comments like \"you look mysterious\" but getting to a date is tough. Perhaps I'm coming off too \"gamey\" like they believe I say those things to all the girls- even though I'm not looking for a FWB. \\n\\nI genuinely want to make a connection although often my back

English isn't my native language so hope you understand.\\n\\nI met this girl at a bar 3 months again. She is a model so very beautiful but also intelligent and fun. I instantly knew I had to take her out. So I brought her Home, we kissed and talked and I invited her out on a date. She just came out of a toxic relationship a year ago so she was afraid to rush something and was very focused on knowing my intentions. She Also was very cautious with signals she didn't like. \\n\\nWell she have ADHD, PDA and daddy issues. All was going well but sometimes I had a hard time understanding a stop in conversations as I wanted to explain myself and sometimes I needed explanations if I didn't understand her. But because of her PDA she had a hard time explaining if she didn't want to.\\n\\nSomeday I wrote something to her because I was so focused on not crossing her boundaries that I got insecure in crossing them. So I wrote a long message to her and she responded in a wrong way. We saw each other later that evening for dinner, drank some wine and bought some gin. We got drunk and me especially so I wanted to talk about her message. She agreed and said I misunderstood it. I got too drunk and wanted explanations and when she wanted to leave I pushed her to the sofa in frustration.\\n\\nShe left and wouldn't respond to me. Made All the mistakes and begged her to answer me and give me one more chance. She didnt respond a few days until I told her she couldn't do that to me. She said I had disrespected her and crossed her boundaries. I wrote alot and she told me I got enough chances. A few days later she wrote to me in another tone saying sorry for her responses and how it worked out. I told her calmly that I would like another chance to prove it to her, that it was low of me to beg and that I just wanted to see her.\\n\\nFirst she said no but later she was not clear in her messages. And the next day she wrote to me about her first week in school and how hard it was. Asked her to Come to me and she did. She game to me and laid on my lap. She slept most of the time but afterwards she was willing to see me again and said she maybe wanted to give me a chance but she didnt know. I was so focused on wanting that chance and wanted her to say it. So a couple of dates later it was about getting a chance. She didnt want to say it yet but that she was open to it. Talked about having the freedom to do what she wanted. She was pressured by People thinking we were still dating and wanted to get that away but it was a lot of mixed signals .I think she was confused and that made me confused. I had so much focus on doing the right thing and not setting the right boundaries. So this friday I invited her out and after a small discussion we left the place and had a long confusing talk. That she liked our relation but that she wasn't ready for a relationship right now. She have said that before. She asked my alot of questions as why we fit together etc. She told me what she liked about me and what she didnt like I did. But at the end we agreed not to talk about it anymore and just take it naturally.\\n\\nSo we had a good time until the end where her best friend showed us the finger. I said it wasnt nice and she said it was just something he did and that he didnt mean it in a bad way. I didnt think about it anymore and when he came back she told me she told him about my comment so he told me he didnt mean anything about it. As he was telling me this, she was speaking about it too and when I chose to listen to him she got annoyed and went to the other site of him and then she just left the bar without saying anything. I wrote her the next day to give me a call and talk about what happened. She didnt want to talk and told me to write. So I wrote to her I felt disrespected and didnt understand why she got annoyed. She replied to me confused, didnt understand and was just cold. But I stood my ground and then she wrote she couldnt countinue the relation. Didnt answer her and then she sent a smiley with a sad face. The next day I wrote a long message to her about I wasnt my self the last couple of weeks, that I was confused and that I am myself now and meant what I wrote but that I was willing to forget it and get a fresh start where we dont talk about the past, future, emotions or thoughts. And that it wasnt about getting a chance, just to be natural and take it from there. Wasnt needy or desperate, just told her we could forget about it.\\n\\nShe replied with I dont have time to read this.\\n\\nThis friday she said earlier that she didnt want to ruin our relation.\\n\\nSo i realised she lost respect towards me. That I was too good to her after I got a chance.\\n\\nI didnt reply to her message.\\n\\nI still want her but I am unsure about what the best approach should be. I appreciate All the help I can get. I know about no-contact and all but want to have all possibilities open.\\n\\nShe is a complicated girl but she is a fantastic girl when she goes fully into it.\\n\\nRemember begging and pleading did help in the past, not that I want to do it again but just to tell you that its complicated and that anything can happen. So I want all the advice I can get to get her to see me, gain respect in me and maybe get her to see that it was disrespectful.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you in advance :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n","489   I'm serious.

say something, what next? How do you start the conversation?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Well, what you say to start the conversation depends on a few things, like:**\\n\\n**-The environment.** The way you start a conversation during the day may be a bit different than the way you start the conversation at a nightclub.\\n\\n**-The girl.** If she’s in a rush, you’ll have to move the conversation quickly. Whereas, if she’s standing and watching a street performer, you know she has some time, and there are plenty of things to talk about.\\`\\n\\n**-Your goals.** Maybe you’re not super interested in the girl and you just want to build some social momentum. Or, maybe your intuition literally forced you to talk to this girl because she caught your eye so strongly.\\n\\nWhatever the situation, this post will help you start the conversation well and move things forward with the girl.\\n\\n(Keep in mind – when you’re in a naturally social environment, like perhaps a social sport, house party, or a get together with new friends, you can be pretty casual with the way you start a conversation. That’s because it’s expected to be social in these types of situations. We’ll go over this as well.)\\n\\n**We’ll talk about 5 easy ways you can start a conversation with any girl…**\\n\\nLet’s get right into it…\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**1. Going “Direct”**\\n\\nHere, you basically state your interest from the beginning. This is one of my favorite ways to start a conversation, because it cuts through the bullshit.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** Anytime.\\n\\n**You can say:**\\n\\n*“Hey, I know this is really random, but I saw you walking by and I thought you were cute. So, I had to say ‘Hi’. I’m \\[Your name\\].”*\\n\\nIt’s very important to say this one slowly and shake her hand afterward.\\n\\nYou want to say it like this…\\n\\n*“Hey… I know this is reaaaallly random… but I saw you walking by... and I thought you were cute… So I had to say ‘Hi’…I’m \\[Your name\\].”*\\n\\nBy delivering it slowly, you’ll come across as more confident and she’ll hang on your words. By shaking her hand, you’ll initiate physical touch from the beginning, which will make her more comfortable with you.\\n\\nGoing “direct” is powerful because it shows confidence, and if she stays in the conversation, it’s a sign that she’s at least somewhat interested in you.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2. Situational**\\n\\nHere, you pick out something from the environment, and use it to start the conversation.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** At a bar or club, or when the two of you are stationary (in one place, perhaps looking at something like a street performer).\\n\\nFor example, let’s say the two of you are staring at one of those street performers who pose as a statue.\\n\\nYou could say, *“I always confuse these things with real statues. My friends always make fun of me for it.”* This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek way to initiate the conversation.\\n\\nIf you’re in a bar or club, you could even say something simple like, *“Do you know what the name of this club is?”*\\n\\nThe key is to deliver this with a slight smile, so she knows you’re being playful. You want it to come across in more of a fun way rather than a serious tone.\\n\\nThe “situational” conversation starter can be powerful because it already gives you a topic to discuss. It can also be a great way to make her laugh from the beginning. However, make sure not to stay on the topic too long, as it can go stale and get boring. There’s only so much you can say about a street performer.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3. The “Where is Starbucks?”**\\n\\nYou’re walking down the street and you stop a girl, then ask her where the nearest Starbucks is.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** During the day while you’re walking in a city that has Starbucks (if that city doesn’t have Starbucks, any other popular cafe/restaurant will do).\\n\\n**Here’s the key to pulling this one off…**\\n\\nFirst, spot the girl you want to talk to. Typically, she’ll be walking towards you on the sidewalk.\\n\\nOnce you’re within 10 feet of her, slowly raise your hand in front of you to get her attention. She’ll usually see your hand and your eye contact before she gets to you.\\n\\nThen, plant your feet and stop.\\n\\nAsk, *“Hey, do you know where the nearest Starbucks is?”*\\n\\nBefore she can fully respond, cut her off and say, *“Actually, I just thought you were cute and I wanted to meet you. I’m \\[Your name\\].\"*\\n\\n(It’s important to do this BEFORE she finishes giving you the directions, because the social tendency is to give the quick directions and immediately walk away.)\\n\\nThis conversation starter is powerful because it allows you to gauge her vibe and attractiveness before you show your interest. For example, simply by her response and the way she starts to deliver her answer, you can tell how open she is to having a conversation with you. For example, if she smiles and lights up little bit, you know you have a good chance to make something happen.\\n\\nPlus, if she’s not as attractive as you thought she was from afar, you can just ask the Starbucks question and let her give you the directions, then walk away. It’s very low risk.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**4. The Simple Introduction**\\n\\nHere, you don’t try to get too cute. You just give her a simple, *“Hey, how’s it going?* Or, *“Hey, I’m \\[Your name\\]. How’s it going?”*\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** At bars and clubs and other social environments.\\n\\nIt’s important to deliver this with confidence, strong eye contact, and a lower tone of voice. Otherwise, you’ll come across in a platonic “just friends” sort of way, and you’ll often get brushed off by women.\\n\\nIt’s powerful because of its simplicity. You don’t have to dig for what to say. You know that you have this simple conversation starter in your back pocket.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere you have it – you now have 4 ways to start a conversation with any women and in any environment.\\n\\nYou no longer have an excuse to not approach and start conversations with women you desire.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDavid Davidson\\n\\nr/BrosDatingAdvice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n","499   Unfortunately this post was removed by mods for reasons..\\n\\nSo, I decided to post it again (hopefully it doesn't break any rules this time) because I believe this post can be helpful to many:\\n\\nHi, David Davidson here!\\n\\nApproaching women is one thing - but once you build up the courage to walk up to a girl and say something, what next? How do you start the conversation?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Well, what you say to start the conversation depends on a few things, like:**\\n\\n**-The environment.** The way you start a conversation during the day may be a bit different than the way you start the conversation at a nightclub.\\n\\n**-The girl.** If she’s in a rush, you’ll have to move the conversation quickly. Whereas, if she’s standing and watching a street performer, you know she has some time, and there are plenty of things to talk about.\\`\\n\\n**-Your goals.** Maybe you’re not super interested in the girl and you just want to build some social momentum. Or, maybe your intuition literally forced you to talk to this girl because she caught your eye so strongly.\\n\\nWhatever the situation, this post will help you start the conversation well and move things forward with the girl.\\n\\n(Keep in mind – when you’re in a naturally social environment, like perhaps a social sport, house party, or a get together with new friends, you can be pretty casual with the way you start a conversation. That’s because it’s expected to be social in these types of situations. We’ll go over this as well.)\\n\\n**We’ll talk about 5 easy ways you can start a conversation with any girl…**\\n\\nLet’s get right into it…\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1. Going “Direct”**\\n\\nHere, you basically state your interest from the beginning. This is one of my favorite ways to start a conversation, because it cuts through the bullshit.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** Anytime.\\n\\n**You can say:**\\n\\n*“Hey, I know this is really random, but I saw you walking by and I thought you were cute. So, I had to say ‘Hi’. I’m \\[Your name\\].”*\\n\\nIt’s very important to say this one slowly and shake her hand afterward.\\n\\nYou want to say it like this…\\n\\n*“Hey… I know this is reaaaallly random… but I saw you walking by... and I thought you were cute… So I had to say ‘Hi’…I’m \\[Your name\\].”*\\n\\nBy delivering it slowly, you’ll come across as more confident and she’ll hang on your words. By shaking her hand, you’ll initiate physical touch from the beginning, which will make her more comfortable with you.\\n\\nGoing “direct” is powerful because it shows confidence, and if she stays in the conversation, it’s a sign that she’s at least somewhat interested in you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2. Situational**\\n\\nHere, you pick out something from the environment, and use it to start the conversation.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** At a bar or club, or when the two of you are stationary (in one place, perhaps looking at something like a street performer).\\n\\nFor example, let’s say the two of you are staring at one of those street performers who pose as a statue.\\n\\nYou could say, *“I always confuse these things with real statues. My friends always make fun of me for it.”* This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek way to initiate the conversation.\\n\\nIf you’re in a bar or club, you could even say something simple like, *“Do you know what the name of this club is?”*\\n\\nThe key is to deliver this with a slight smile, so she knows you’re being playful. You want it to come across in more of a fun way rather than a serious tone.\\n\\nThe “situational” conversation starter can be powerful because it already gives you a topic to discuss. It can also be a great way to make her laugh from the beginning. However, make sure not to stay on the topic too long, as it can go stale and get boring. There’s only so much you can say about a street performer.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**3.

want to say that I am not good with girls at all. I've never been and and I felt that I have to change sth. My intention is not to have sex every day, I just want to meet new people and make new experiences with girl bc in my opinion that is something that is part of life.\\n\\nMoreover this challenge is not only about getting better with girls but also about getting more social in general. I've been always afraid to approach new people and I feel like 90% of all people (doesn't matter whether man or woman) feel the same. Just think of how many great people you could have met, if you just had said what you think (f.i. there is someone with cool shoes and you tell him and you guys end up being good friends for life). I feel I have more to win than to lose so thats why I am doing this.\\n\\n1st day: \\n\\nChallenge 1 was to approach 5 stranger, doesn't matter how.\\n\\n These are my experiences:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* I approached 5 people in the gym\\n* I asked them a question and try to hold the conversation\\n* I realized: First action, then good feeling and motivation and not the other way around. So whenever you're not in the mood for sth, take a little step and do sth which brings you towards your goal. You will feel better afterwards and your motivation grows so you want to continue\\n* I am still afraid of approaching girls w/o a question, e.g. just say hello\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFor me, approaching someone with a question is much easier than just saying hello. I think it is bc if I ask a question, I know what is gonna come next. But if I just say hello, you never know where the conversation is going. You have less control of the situation and thats why it makes me more afraid.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am sharing my experiences about day 2 in the next post. Please excuse my English, I know I need to imoprove haha

You may be directed to this post in the future if you have questions about getting banned for something that used to fly in the past here.\\]\\n\\n# Rules / Guidelines\\n\\nThe primary focus of Seddit (r/seduction) is the study of human seduction. Mainly, how to integrate specific seduction and self-improvement techniques into our long-term personalities and how to succeed at one's dating goals, whether that's casual sex or a relationship.\\n\\nWhile the discussions within Seddit focus primarily on the male seduction of females, most techniques and information referenced may be applied whether or not genders are flipped, etc.\\n\\nWhen evaluating if a post is appropriate, the golden rule is to ask yourself: **\"Does this post help someone get laid or land a relationship?\"**\\n\\n    Table of Contents\\n    1.) Reddit's Rules\\n    2.) Appropriate Topics\\n    3.) Common Inappropriate Posts\\n    4.) Other Inappropriate posts\\n    5.) Celebrity / Industry AMAs\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 1.) [Reddit's Rules]( \\n\\nIt falls on all of you to read through Reddit's Rules. Some notable implications of their rules that need to be highlighted:\\n\\n* Rule 1 - This is basically Seddit's Rule 4: Keep it civil and on topic. It's common sense: Don't harass or bully people. Don't incite violence. **AskSeddit was banned, apparently because people were breaking this rule over there. So, expect permanent bans to hit with fewer warnings.**\\n* Rule 4 - *This rule means that anyone under the age of 18 can't ask for advice here.* I do not know what recourse you have and I am sorry.\\n\\nMake sure you all read through Reddit's rules in their entirety!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 2.) Appropriate Topics\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Field Reports**\\n\\nGreat field reports focus on the techniques, mindsets and phrases you specifically used that changed the course of the night to being successful. **If FR is a failure, then be sure you can point out specifically what would have turned it into a success. A good FR says \"This is what I did, and why it worked\".**\\n\\nWhile we appreciate functional Field Reports, often users post what are essentially diaries, giving a rundown of the night without any focus on actual techniques used. For instance:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;I went to the starbucks today, and smiled at cashier, but got too nervous to say anything so I just left.\\n\\n*This doesn't do anything to help someone get laid or work towards a relationship*. Something better might include some introspection about what exactly you did, particularly after you corrected the mistake and got better results.\\n\\nShare positive value with the community, this keeps the sub filled with useful material! Remember to add the **Field Report** flair to your post!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Links to Articles / Videos**\\n\\nThere are tons of great blogs, vlogs, podcast, forums, and articles about seduction, and we love to stay up to date on what is out there in the community. Post these if you find them useful! **But remember that you must still have body text in your post summarizing the content you are linking!**\\n\\n*However, if the video is more about fun (like approaching while holding a dildo), it might be removed* because it isn't a good example of actually helping Sedditors hook up, etc.\\n\\nAlso, videos of friend-zoned guys or guys bad at pickup will probably not be allowed, as they violate the golden rule of \"Does this post help someone get laid or land a relationship?\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Sharing Techniques**\\n\\nIf you have come up with your own techniques, SHARE THEM!!!. We rely on the community for new approaches and ideas, just make sure they are field tested with at least 20 approaches.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Asking specific questions or basic questions**\\n\\nWhile the subreddit can become clogged with questions like \"How do I approach\" or \"How do I kiss someone?\", more advanced topics can provide a rich discussion. Examples:\\n\\n1. How do I manage dating multiple people?\\n2. What's the best way to increase my chances of a one night stand?\\n3. Best way to arrange a threesome?\\n4. Struggling with a specific aspect of inner-game\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 3.) Common Inappropriate Posts\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Overly Beginner Topics**\\n\\nThings like:\\n\\n1. How do I approach\\n2. How do I get a number\\n3. I'm in college, how do I talk to girls/boys\\n4. How to kiss someone\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Physical Limitation**\\n\\nThere have been plenty of posts on [**Why Looks Don't Matter**](  **But this is oversimplifying the matter.**\\n\\nThe truth is, looks are just part of the picture. So they matter, but other things do, too. \\*Game\" can compensate for looks if one has the social skills and hasn't given up.\\n\\nAnd at the end of the day, seduction is a form of social interaction and physical appearance is not a social skill.\\* If you have good looks but no game, you lose. If you have good game without the best looks, you can still get a good result.\\n\\n* **Will this work for me? I'm depressed and/or awkward**\\n\\nShort answer: YES!!!\\n\\nMany of the guys that have transformed their lives started as some of the most awkward, hard case, forever alone people you have ever met.\\n\\nNote: this subreddit is not a substitute for therapy, which is one of the most underrated tools available to combat depression, anxiety, etc. If you haven't tried this, it's worth a try, especially methods like [group therapy](  or [cognitive behavioral therapy]( \\n\\nStudy the sidebar and Seddit history as best you can, and if you are struggling after 3 months of serious work, then you can post about what specifically isn't working. Don't make a post until you've put in the foundational reading and work in.\\n\\nAnd again, if it's a basic question, post at /r/askseddit.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Asking for Advice**\\n\\n~~Any calls for specific situational advice with a specific female should be directed to~~ r/askSeddit~~. Note that is askSEDDIT, not askREDDIT.~~\\n\\n~~It exists to give you a place where sedditors can answer your questions without bogging down the frontpage of~~ r/seduction~~.~~\\n\\n(While we used to have a venue for these kinds of specific questions, AskSeddit was taken down without notice. **We may have to re-establish a Basic Questions thread but that will have to wait for now.**)\\n\\n*The problem with specific topics is they are specific to YOUR situation, while broad pickup topics are applicable to EVERY guys situation.* We have about 736k subscribers, and the focus of this sub is to help everyone.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Rage Comics / Failure links**\\n\\nIn short, things like rage comics, stuff about forever alone guys or friend-zoned losers are not appropriate, and will be deleted. Simply making fun of the community or guys that aren't good with women does nothing to HELP guys with women.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Advertisement or Solicitations**\\n\\n**Seddit is not an advertisement forum. Soliciting for, or advertising products and/or services, is not allowed here.** And any information posted should be aimed at helping progress our member's abilities in the arts of seduction. *A specific reason why the link is helpful to sedditors should be accompanied in the post or in a comment.*\\n\\nLinks should be made to actual content, rather than advertising a book or promoting a website's homepage. Any blatant advertisement of products that cost money without prior approval from moderators can be met with deletion.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 4.) Other Inappropriate Topics\\n\\nThis is **not** the venue for:\\n\\n* Debates about:\\n   * Whether looks matter or not\\n   * Vaccines\\n   * Nofap\\n   * Pseudoscience\\n   * Any topic that would require wading through research papers to have a productive, informed conversation.\\n* Conspiracy topics\\n* Posts or comments that boil down to arguing over semantics. \\n   * Arguing that the friend-zone doesn't exist\\n   * Arguing for a new definition of *a word that's already defined in the dictionary.*\\n* **Shit-posting, rants, or** [**circlejerk**](  **posts**\\n* Attacking (flaming) any member will get either a warning or a ban at the moderators discretion.\\n* Calling any member a rapist, insinuating anything negative about their character because they practice seduction, or just plain name calling are all forbidden.\\n* The \"don't ask a fish\" argument is tired. If you have a point about someone's bad advice, debunk the bad advice on its own merits.\\n* Policing what dating goals a person should have is also out of bounds.\\n   * Judging whether or not people should want a relationship or not.\\n   * Judging whether or not people should go after someone who is taken or not.\\n   * Judging people according to your sense of morality in general, or slut-shaming specifically.\\n* **If you think a comment isn't helpful or breaks the rules, then report it to the moderators.** Do not engage with the person posting or commenting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 5.) Celebrity / Industry AMAs\\n\\nPlease contact and schedule these through moderators. We maintain a numbered list of Official AMA's, and for inclusion you must schedule with moderators.\\n\\nFurthermore, AMAs are often the source of flaming and attacks from hostile subreddits, so we schedule moderators to be online for the AMA to control these. If these are not scheduled through the mod team and these attacks occur, the entire thread might get removed.\\n\\n**All AMA's must follow the Reddit standard:**\\n\\n1. Questions are answered in real time, not hours later. Make the AMA when you will be at the keyboard.\\n2. Questions must be answered on Reddit, in the thread. Not YouTube, not on a blog.\\n3. Be prepared to answer any question, not just commercial ones.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# Happy hunting!   \n","636   &amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat is the best response for seducing a traditional-ish woman when

even teach because I had kizomba background it helped me to become better at bachata very fast. Here is the deal,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n I've met this girl and we ve been speaking and bonding for more than 3 week of parties, going out on dates but when I tried to be closer to her I felt rejected, so I have become sad for the next days  because I really like this girl, she also  ignored my calls and texts, Fast forward  three days after I  meet this amazing dancer who shares the same passion for Romeo Santos like me, we bond very fast, for me its like love at first sight, and you know how many dancers I dance with,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n I have never felt that before in bachata. the next day we meet at another party where she is taxi dancers, fast forward we sleep together in my place, ( I really like this girl also like a lot) but then the next day girl number one reaches out to me, I see her in a party where girl number 2 is not, and we become very close after the party ( we kiss, we cuddle... in the street not in my place or hers), turns out I still like number 1, but now I like girl number 1 and 2 at the same time with same level of interest both are great dancers. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEventually, we will be in a party where both are and before you know it the next day this scenario happens, since I slept with girl number 2 I didnt ignore her as much as I ignored girl number 1 during that night, ( she was so sad, and she cried) I asked for forgivness and now I have to make a choice, I also explained to both girls the situation, and both are still fond of me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n I dont know how to make a choice especially in the local scene of bachata. The only thing I can see doing is lose them both, so no one gets hurts but I can't choose one of them, because I pretty much have feelings for both of them. Sorry for my english.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do you guys think ?

When we met in met in person we spoke a little bit, and I found out that she's in medical school. We spoke a little bit on how it was going, and then we went our separate ways. I found her somewhat interesting. She lives in my hometown. However, we only met to make business, and nothing else.\\n\\nShould I leave it at that, or do you think maybe I could try to send her a message to ask how classes are going and invite her out for a coffee. \\n\\nI don't want to invade anybody's personal space or be creepy. I don't want to be inapropriate or out of context. It's just that it's been a long time since I met someone I found interesting.\\n\\nPlease, understand that I don't wan't to bother this other person.

If I had to describe my biggest personality flaw(s), it's that I'm monotone, passive, serious, and fairly boring/nerdy. I have lots of friends I spend time with in small groups, but I tend to struggle in larger ones. I've been told I'm really mature for my age, which I'm trying to change.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI get nervous with things like dancing or making small talk in large groups. Every time someone talks to me it turns into a deep conversation about my job or passions before I can even realize what's happening. I really don't know what to do about that- it's not the most attractive thing to women as far as I can tell. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnother thing is taking photos; I get really nervous when taking photos, especially if it's in a group and we have to make a \"silly\" face. I can't break out of my shell in moments like that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'll just end this off by saying that I'm always really nice to everyone and make an effort to make them laugh and smile. My friend was giving me a ride once and she told me that her boyfriend really enjoyed talking with me, which really made me happy because I really like having both of them as my friends. It's just that my default personality is serious, and I'm trying to \"let my hair down\" a little more.

                                \n","1023  I'm looking to try my hand in dating again in 2023. And in case the title to the post wasn't any indication, masculine women are my thing. By that, I don't just mean being a sporty tomboy or being muscular, both of which I especially like.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI also mean having traits such as dominance *(meaning wearing the pants)*, courage, heroism, protectiveness, being able to stomach violence and gore *(Guys seem to handle it better in my experience)*, being willing to fight and even kill *(to feed/defend oneself or others)*, skill with weaponry or martial arts, and so on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn the past, I've been accused of being a latent homosexual for being attracted to this rather than feminine girls. Especially for being into women with muscles, and I've even been called a beta for being into dominance instead of submissiveness.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, I just wanna know how I can go about dating in the real world, knowing what I like. Going to a gym to look for a strong and/or masculine girl sounds like a good idea at face value--especially since I can use that to get fit as well--but a lot of people there period are there to work out and not be bothered. Other ideas are classes involving combat sports or weapons. I've been out of the game for a long time now, so I have no idea where to start.

Watching this sub feels like the blind leading the blind most of the time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere's the thing about your mindset:\\n\\n**Women see through your bullshit:**\\n\\nAny young woman who would be considered by the general public  to be attractive, has been getting harassed, propositioned, and tricked by men since they were 15 years old. They're fantastic lie detectors and they can tell as easily as you can when someone's behaving desperately or inauthentically to get something from them. They're going to view leaning on a bar with them with the same skepticism and contempt that you would view a used car salesman with. \\n\\nAnd yeah, maybe if you went into the dealership *looking* to leave with shitty used car and accepting the grift, you'd tolerate their bs. In the same way, you *can* probably approach 100 women and find the one who would've said yes to anyone who asked meeting their minimum standards, but is that *really* what you want? Does that make you feel *good* about who you are? Was the drunk, flat, emotionally distant, jizz into latex worth a night of behaving like a jackass towards people who mostly have contempt for you and clearly see that you view them as an antagonistic force to be tricked in some kind of game?\\n\\nWhat's the solution? **Be authentic, drop \"pick up art,\" and be someone who you're proud to be.**\\n\\nLet's face it. Most of you are presenting facades of yourself to women because you're ashamed of yourself. Most of you are also seeking out pick up because you see being chosen for sex as validating to your deep insecurities and feelings of rejection and unworthiness.\\n\\nThe women who will fuck you with passion like your cock contained the elixir of life, a woman who will love you for who you are, *will only respect you when you respect yourself*, and they can mostly tell. Even if you manage to fake it through a night, they'll figure you out and either ghost you or have contempt for you through a stagnant relationship.\\n\\nAnyone will tell you, **confidence is the key** to being respected. But where does confidence come from? Confidence comes from doing hard things. Things that you might fail at but you do them anyways because they're meaningful.\\n\\n* Take a martial art\\n* Learn a new skill in a new community, like a cooking class or something\\n* Join meetups or a sport you've never played\\n* Work on your mental wellness and go meditate or see a therapist\\n* Connect with family you've had difficulty with\\n* Take a job that challenges you more\\n* Do something you've always dreamed of but been afraid to do\\n\\nWhen you do hard things, even if you struggle, even if you fail, you *will* feel proud with the right mindset.\\n\\nThink about the difference in how conversations go with someone who's challenging themselves, vs someone who is taking the easy path in life.\\n\\nNot taking difficult risks: \"Everything's great, I closed some important deals and  I feel like I'm really ahead for next week, maybe I'll take a day off. Glad to be here now, this is such a fun club!\"\\n\\n**vs**\\n\\nTaking difficult risks: \"It's been challenging, but I feel hopeful. I reached out to my brother who I haven't talked to in years since his wife yelled at my kid and he defended her behaviour. It felt strange talking to him and not knowing whats going on in his life, I've really missed him\"\\n\\nor\\n\\n\"Fun but tough, I just got out of my 6th Aikido class and everyone else there has been doing it for years, so I feel pretty uncoordinated. I'm really connecting with people there, though, and I'm really trying to find humility in being constantly schooled  and thrown to the ground by college freshmen half my size.\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThink how much more interested you'd be in connecting to the second or third person over the first.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**You are now:**\\n\\n* Talking to someone about something that's extremely interesting and emotionally tractable because your life has the conflict and excitement of challenge\\n* Demonstrating your courage and will, your dedication to doing what's meaningful over what's easy\\n* Being vulnerable in a way which reflects favorably on you, opens the door for them to respond with something emotionally vulnerable about themselves, for you to validate each other, and for you to really connect.\\n* Doing so in a way that will stand up to scrutiny, because it's real\\n* And furthermore, you're expanding your network and meeting a lot more women in prolonged interactions that aren't just hitting on them in bars. \\n\\nYou can't fake confidence. When you talk about your struggles with doing something difficult, you open yourself up to real connection that people respect. It allows you to humble brag, to show you care about improving yourself, and opens the door for reciprocity from them.\\n\\nIf you think of **ANY** story, movies, books, whatever, stories land with us when they connect authentically with reality in some way and contain characters who are changed by struggle and adversity. Even comedies and cartoons. Your life's story needs to be this if you ever want to feel good about yourself.\\n\\nWhen you prioritize authenticity, you're also treating women like humans who are smart, and worthy of sharing your true self with. Give respect, get respect. And come across as confident and not thinly guarding insecurities. They can tell.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe thing about being authentic, vulnerable and challenging yourself, is that you'll find yourself just feeling proud, and might fall into a long term relationship with someone who respects your boundaries, shares your interests and meets your sexual needs. You'll have the confidence to be with women you actually respect and admire. Or you'll develop lots of satisfying flings with people you share struggles with. The side effect of being proud and having authentic and intimate connections who hold you up is that you won't feel the need to engage in this PUA shit anymore.\\n\\nThe irony is that the more you focus on pick up game as a sport or a game, the worse you actually get at connecting. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nChallenge yourself, be vulnerable, humanize women, maintain firm boundaries, and unjoin this sub.

So after I get a response, do I just ask them about something? Or maybe I’m just too cringe to being with?\\n\\nHere are the examples:\\n\\nConv 1.\\n\\n\\[me\\]:hey You have captivating smile  : )\\n\\n\\[her\\]: hey :D thank you very much :D \\n\\n\\[me\\]: alright all is set. Wedding next week? \\n\\n\\[me\\]: but we should have our first date first, when it’s alright with you? : )\\n\\nConv 2.\\n\\n\\[me\\]: zarapata <this word has no meaning and sounds dumb at in my language.

\n","1266  FIELD REPORT:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\*Not verbatim but I'll try and keep it close enough.\\n\\nSaturday. October 29th. UK. \\n\\n2 Days before Halloween (so plenty of Halloween costumes and Halloween theme going on)\\n\\nI'm 36. Male. Introvert(ish). Struggle with SA. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCracked a can of carling, did a bit of grooming, threw on a nice top and jeans and a spritz of cologne before heading out. \\n\\nWent to the bus stop. 3 girls, early 20's (one is crazy fit, one is beer goggle fit, and one is slowly becoming a land whale) already waiting for the bus. Before I even check the timetable one girl tells me it's 17 mins away so I get the feeling they must have at least been intrigued by physicality (I exercise regularly). I start talking to them but they start to get a bit cold on me. I clumsily say something about getting to hang out with three beautiful women while waiting for the bus.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe make small talk but they don't seem that interested. There are silences but I don't awkwardly start trying to create a conversation. One girl is nice, one girl is passive and the third girl is sending me bitch vibes. I ignore it for the most part.\\n\\nI ask a \"deep\" question and bitchy girl tries to call me out on it. I calmly respond that it's not like we're ever gonna see each other again so why not, it's at least more interesting than elevator conversation.\\n\\nBitch lady tries to undermine me yet again by asking if I'm going out alone. I tell her I'm late and heading to a group of people at a bar (technically I'm going out alone, but I am heading to a bar for a meet up group of people I've never met).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe get on the bus. I make a bit of conversation, ask a few questions, try and generate a bit of push and pull but they just seem disinterested in me so they keep trying to drag me into their frame control. They partly succeed because I kind of did simp a bit on them towards the end of the bus ride, when we get off I get the feeling they want to get away from me so I so I regain the frame by stopping them and say thanks for the company and wish them a good night.\\n\\nNine out of ten times in the past that poor encounter would have sunk me into a deep dark thought pattern and I'd ruminate about it all night. Not this time. I let that failed encounter pass through me like a ghost (still annoying because I wasn't rude, nor was I acting \"beta\"). They just wouldn't give me a chance to demonstrate value, have a chat and a laugh while killing time with me while waiting for the bus.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo I get to the bar for a meet up group. Grab a beer. Stand around awkwardly for a bit trying to find someone to say hi to and generate a conversation with but nobody really giving me an invitation to join their circles of conversation.\\n\\nA girl walks in (part of the meet up group) and I start talking to her but it doesn't go well. Just a clunky conversation but I'm not attracted to her so it doesn't phase me too much. In fact I recognize that she's actually the one being socially \"difficult\" and awkward with me rather than the other way around.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI move on to another group and sit down, have a chat but the guy is really drunk and keeps talk-spitting in my face so I wait for a que and slide around to talk to another girl. It's a better conversation but I'm not that into her and I played it perhaps a bit too \"cool\" by never really answering her questions about where I'm from or what I do.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI get bored of her and excuse myself. I hit the bar to get another drink. While waiting I make small talk with a pretty girl dressed as a fire warden (although I mistake her for a construction worker) who's ordering drinks for what I must assume is a group of her friends. I make a joke about one of the drinks being for me but it doesn't really land. I ask what's she looking for tonight hoping she'll ask me the same question and I can say something along the lines of looking to laugh, dance and find a spark. She leaves, I brush it off. Get my drink, head back to the meet up group. I spot 40-50 year old woman on her own and chat with her for a bit. I'm not interested in her but it's better than standing around not talking to anyone. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMAIN ENCOUNTER:\\n\\nWhile talking to her I spot a girl on her own, filming the group on her phone. I approach. Ask if she's part of the group. She says no. So I teasingly accuse her of being a spy. She laughs. We start talking and it's all very natural. I make her laugh a lot, she makes me laugh. We discuss a variety of topics. Turns out she looks 25, but is a 35 year Muslim girl from Turkey who drinks, smokes, poly-am, bisexual who's here for 2 months as part of academic research.\\n\\nShe finishes her a drink I offer to get her another one.\\n\\nI lead, take charge and decide we should sit down in a corner together.\\n\\nWe flirt, laugh, drink and end up making out for a while.\\n\\nI tell her we should keep on partying and go to the coolest place in town, her bedroom. She thinks it's super fun but she can't because she lives with her academic supervisor. She asks if we can go back to my place (full disclosure I'm currently living at my aunt's place and I'm honest about it to her). We make out, cuddle. She even slides into my chest and closes her eyes. After a minute of this she decides we can go back to her place as her supervisor is gone for a week.\\n\\nWe head for a taxi but she wants to take a bus back to save me the taxi fair (how awesome is this girl!). Anyways I take charge and we grab a taxi (it was literally cheaper than the bus anyways).\\n\\nAnyways, we get back to hers. Open a can of G&amp;T and have one sip before getting to the bedroom.\\n\\nSex was great. I know I made her orgasm. She's bloody loud too, which is always appreciated.\\n\\nLiterally after we finish having sex she asks if I want to go or stay. I say I want to stay. I suspect she was feeling lonely, homesick and wanted to feel the presence of a man in her life, someone to cuddle up against in bed, and I just happened to be the right person at the right time.\\n\\nThe next day she seemed a bit more cold and distant to me, at least at first, but I think she received some work/uni emails that stressed her out. We have a coffee, talk for a bit and I leave.\\n\\nWe'll probs meet up again. maybe for a hook up, maybe just to hang out, she's bisexual and doesn't really believe in LTR's so there's always that wonderful potential that we might go out and find a girl for a three way without it getting too serious between us.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPS! we've added each other on IG and literally one minute after posting a story she's peeked at it so something tells me she's still at least somewhat into me.

English isn't my native language so hope you understand.\\n\\nI met this girl at a bar 3 months again. She is a model so very beautiful but also intelligent and fun. I instantly knew I had to take her out. So I brought her Home, we kissed and talked and I invited her out on a date. She just came out of a toxic relationship a year ago so she was afraid to rush something and was very focused on knowing my intentions. She Also was very cautious with signals she didn't like. \\n\\nWell she have ADHD, PDA and daddy issues. All was going well but sometimes I had a hard time understanding a stop in conversations as I wanted to explain myself and sometimes I needed explanations if I didn't understand her. But because of her PDA she had a hard time explaining if she didn't want to.\\n\\nSomeday I wrote something to her because I was so focused on not crossing her boundaries that I got insecure in crossing them. So I wrote a long message to her and she responded in a wrong way. We saw each other later that evening for dinner, drank some wine and bought some gin. We got drunk and me especially so I wanted to talk about her message. She agreed and said I misunderstood it. I got too drunk and wanted explanations and when she wanted to leave I pushed her to the sofa in frustration.\\n\\nShe left and wouldn't respond to me. Made All the mistakes and begged her to answer me and give me one more chance. She didnt respond a few days until I told her she couldn't do that to me. She said I had disrespected her and crossed her boundaries. I wrote alot and she told me I got enough chances. A few days later she wrote to me in another tone saying sorry for her responses and how it worked out. I told her calmly that I would like another chance to prove it to her, that it was low of me to beg and that I just wanted to see her.\\n\\nFirst she said no but later she was not clear in her messages. And the next day she wrote to me about her first week in school and how hard it was. Asked her to Come to me and she did. She game to me and laid on my lap. She slept most of the time but afterwards she was willing to see me again and said she maybe wanted to give me a chance but she didnt know. I was so focused on wanting that chance and wanted her to say it. So a couple of dates later it was about getting a chance. She didnt want to say it yet but that she was open to it. Talked about having the freedom to do what she wanted. She was pressured by People thinking we were still dating and wanted to get that away but it was a lot of mixed signals .I think she was confused and that made me confused. I had so much focus on doing the right thing and not setting the right boundaries. So this friday I invited her out and after a small discussion we left the place and had a long confusing talk. That she liked our relation but that she wasn't ready for a relationship right now. She have said that before. She asked my alot of questions as why we fit together etc. She told me what she liked about me and what she didnt like I did. But at the end we agreed not to talk about it anymore and just take it naturally.\\n\\nSo we had a good time until the end where her best friend showed us the finger. I said it wasnt nice and she said it was just something he did and that he didnt mean it in a bad way. I didnt think about it anymore and when he came back she told me she told him about my comment so he told me he didnt mean anything about it. As he was telling me this, she was speaking about it too and when I chose to listen to him she got annoyed and went to the other site of him and then she just left the bar without saying anything. I wrote her the next day to give me a call and talk about what happened. She didnt want to talk and told me to write. So I wrote to her I felt disrespected and didnt understand why she got annoyed. She replied to me confused, didnt understand and was just cold. But I stood my ground and then she wrote she couldnt countinue the relation. Didnt answer her and then she sent a smiley with a sad face. The next day I wrote a long message to her about I wasnt my self the last couple of weeks, that I was confused and that I am myself now and meant what I wrote but that I was willing to forget it and get a fresh start where we dont talk about the past, future, emotions or thoughts. And that it wasnt about getting a chance, just to be natural and take it from there. Wasnt needy or desperate, just told her we could forget about it.\\n\\nShe replied with I dont have time to read this.\\n\\nThis friday she said earlier that she didnt want to ruin our relation.\\n\\nSo i realised she lost respect towards me. That I was too good to her after I got a chance.\\n\\nI didnt reply to her message.\\n\\nI still want her but I am unsure about what the best approach should be. I appreciate All the help I can get. I know about no-contact and all but want to have all possibilities open.\\n\\nShe is a complicated girl but she is a fantastic girl when she goes fully into it.\\n\\nRemember begging and pleading did help in the past, not that I want to do it again but just to tell you that its complicated and that anything can happen. So I want all the advice I can get to get her to see me, gain respect in me and maybe get her to see that it was disrespectful.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you in advance :)</td>\n","      <td>No-Incident3025</td>\n","      <td>xwhhva</td>\n","      <td>2022-10-05 17:56:19</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xwhhva/how_to_get_her_back/</td>\n","      <td>1.00</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>489</th>\n","      <td>What to do if I'm afraid of sex?</td>\n","      <td>I'm serious.

How do you start the conversation?\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Well, what you say to start the conversation depends on a few things, like:**\\n\\n**-The environment.** The way you start a conversation during the day may be a bit different than the way you start the conversation at a nightclub.\\n\\n**-The girl.** If she’s in a rush, you’ll have to move the conversation quickly. Whereas, if she’s standing and watching a street performer, you know she has some time, and there are plenty of things to talk about.\\`\\n\\n**-Your goals.** Maybe you’re not super interested in the girl and you just want to build some social momentum. Or, maybe your intuition literally forced you to talk to this girl because she caught your eye so strongly.\\n\\nWhatever the situation, this post will help you start the conversation well and move things forward with the girl.\\n\\n(Keep in mind – when you’re in a naturally social environment, like perhaps a social sport, house party, or a get together with new friends, you can be pretty casual with the way you start a conversation. That’s because it’s expected to be social in these types of situations. We’ll go over this as well.)\\n\\n**We’ll talk about 5 easy ways you can start a conversation with any girl…**\\n\\nLet’s get right into it…\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**1. Going “Direct”**\\n\\nHere, you basically state your interest from the beginning. This is one of my favorite ways to start a conversation, because it cuts through the bullshit.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** Anytime.\\n\\n**You can say:**\\n\\n*“Hey, I know this is really random, but I saw you walking by and I thought you were cute. So, I had to say ‘Hi’. I’m \\[Your name\\].”*\\n\\nIt’s very important to say this one slowly and shake her hand afterward.\\n\\nYou want to say it like this…\\n\\n*“Hey… I know this is reaaaallly random… but I saw you walking by... and I thought you were cute… So I had to say ‘Hi’…I’m \\[Your name\\].”*\\n\\nBy delivering it slowly, you’ll come across as more confident and she’ll hang on your words. By shaking her hand, you’ll initiate physical touch from the beginning, which will make her more comfortable with you.\\n\\nGoing “direct” is powerful because it shows confidence, and if she stays in the conversation, it’s a sign that she’s at least somewhat interested in you.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2. Situational**\\n\\nHere, you pick out something from the environment, and use it to start the conversation.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** At a bar or club, or when the two of you are stationary (in one place, perhaps looking at something like a street performer).\\n\\nFor example, let’s say the two of you are staring at one of those street performers who pose as a statue.\\n\\nYou could say, *“I always confuse these things with real statues. My friends always make fun of me for it.”* This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek way to initiate the conversation.\\n\\nIf you’re in a bar or club, you could even say something simple like, *“Do you know what the name of this club is?”*\\n\\nThe key is to deliver this with a slight smile, so she knows you’re being playful. You want it to come across in more of a fun way rather than a serious tone.\\n\\nThe “situational” conversation starter can be powerful because it already gives you a topic to discuss. It can also be a great way to make her laugh from the beginning. However, make sure not to stay on the topic too long, as it can go stale and get boring. There’s only so much you can say about a street performer.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3. The “Where is Starbucks?”**\\n\\nYou’re walking down the street and you stop a girl, then ask her where the nearest Starbucks is.\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** During the day while you’re walking in a city that has Starbucks (if that city doesn’t have Starbucks, any other popular cafe/restaurant will do).\\n\\n**Here’s the key to pulling this one off…**\\n\\nFirst, spot the girl you want to talk to. Typically, she’ll be walking towards you on the sidewalk.\\n\\nOnce you’re within 10 feet of her, slowly raise your hand in front of you to get her attention. She’ll usually see your hand and your eye contact before she gets to you.\\n\\nThen, plant your feet and stop.\\n\\nAsk, *“Hey, do you know where the nearest Starbucks is?”*\\n\\nBefore she can fully respond, cut her off and say, *“Actually, I just thought you were cute and I wanted to meet you. I’m \\[Your name\\].\"*\\n\\n(It’s important to do this BEFORE she finishes giving you the directions, because the social tendency is to give the quick directions and immediately walk away.)\\n\\nThis conversation starter is powerful because it allows you to gauge her vibe and attractiveness before you show your interest. For example, simply by her response and the way she starts to deliver her answer, you can tell how open she is to having a conversation with you. For example, if she smiles and lights up little bit, you know you have a good chance to make something happen.\\n\\nPlus, if she’s not as attractive as you thought she was from afar, you can just ask the Starbucks question and let her give you the directions, then walk away. It’s very low risk.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**4. The Simple Introduction**\\n\\nHere, you don’t try to get too cute. You just give her a simple, *“Hey, how’s it going?* Or, *“Hey, I’m \\[Your name\\]. How’s it going?”*\\n\\n**When it’s best to use:** At bars and clubs and other social environments.\\n\\nIt’s important to deliver this with confidence, strong eye contact, and a lower tone of voice. Otherwise, you’ll come across in a platonic “just friends” sort of way, and you’ll often get brushed off by women.\\n\\nIt’s powerful because of its simplicity. You don’t have to dig for what to say. You know that you have this simple conversation starter in your back pocket.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere you have it – you now have 4 ways to start a conversation with any women and in any environment.\\n\\nYou no longer have an excuse to not approach and start conversations with women you desire.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDavid Davidson\\n\\nr/BrosDatingAdvice</td>\n","      <td>Sir_David_Davidson</td>\n","      <td>y1cti1</td>\n","      <td>2022-10-11 16:02:38</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/y1cti1/4_easy_ways_to_start_a_conversation_with_any_girl/</td>\n","      <td>1.00</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>499</th>\n","      <td>[REPOST] 4 easy ways to start a conversation with any girl</td>\n","      <td>Unfortunately this post was removed by mods for reasons..\\n\\nSo, I decided to post it again (hopefully it doesn't break any rules this time) because I believe this post can be helpful to many:\\n\\nHi, David Davidson here!\\n\\nApproaching women is one thing - but once you build up the courage to walk up to a girl and say something, what next?

I've never been and and I felt that I have to change sth. My intention is not to have sex every day, I just want to meet new people and make new experiences with girl bc in my opinion that is something that is part of life.\\n\\nMoreover this challenge is not only about getting better with girls but also about getting more social in general. I've been always afraid to approach new people and I feel like 90% of all people (doesn't matter whether man or woman) feel the same. Just think of how many great people you could have met, if you just had said what you think (f.i. there is someone with cool shoes and you tell him and you guys end up being good friends for life). I feel I have more to win than to lose so thats why I am doing this.\\n\\n1st day: \\n\\nChallenge 1 was to approach 5 stranger, doesn't matter how.\\n\\n These are my experiences:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* I approached 5 people in the gym\\n* I asked them a question and try to hold the conversation\\n* I realized: First action, then good feeling and motivation and not the other way around. So whenever you're not in the mood for sth, take a little step and do sth which brings you towards your goal. You will feel better afterwards and your motivation grows so you want to continue\\n* I am still afraid of approaching girls w/o a question, e.g. just say hello\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor me, approaching someone with a question is much easier than just saying hello. I think it is bc if I ask a question, I know what is gonna come next. But if I just say hello, you never know where the conversation is going. You have less control of the situation and thats why it makes me more afraid.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am sharing my experiences about day 2 in the next post.

You may be directed to this post in the future if you have questions about getting banned for something that used to fly in the past here.\\]\\n\\n# Rules / Guidelines\\n\\nThe primary focus of Seddit (r/seduction) is the study of human seduction. Mainly, how to integrate specific seduction and self-improvement techniques into our long-term personalities and how to succeed at one's dating goals, whether that's casual sex or a relationship.\\n\\nWhile the discussions within Seddit focus primarily on the male seduction of females, most techniques and information referenced may be applied whether or not genders are flipped, etc.\\n\\nWhen evaluating if a post is appropriate, the golden rule is to ask yourself: **\"Does this post help someone get laid or land a relationship?\"**\\n\\n    Table of Contents\\n    1.) Reddit's Rules\\n    2.) Appropriate Topics\\n    3.) Common Inappropriate Posts\\n    4.) Other Inappropriate posts\\n    5.) Celebrity / Industry AMAs\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 1.) [Reddit's Rules]( \\n\\nIt falls on all of you to read through Reddit's Rules. Some notable implications of their rules that need to be highlighted:\\n\\n* Rule 1 - This is basically Seddit's Rule 4: Keep it civil and on topic. It's common sense: Don't harass or bully people. Don't incite violence. **AskSeddit was banned, apparently because people were breaking this rule over there. So, expect permanent bans to hit with fewer warnings.**\\n* Rule 4 - *This rule means that anyone under the age of 18 can't ask for advice here.* I do not know what recourse you have and I am sorry.\\n\\nMake sure you all read through Reddit's rules in their entirety!\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 2.) Appropriate Topics\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Field Reports**\\n\\nGreat field reports focus on the techniques, mindsets and phrases you specifically used that changed the course of the night to being successful. **If FR is a failure, then be sure you can point out specifically what would have turned it into a success. A good FR says \"This is what I did, and why it worked\".**\\n\\nWhile we appreciate functional Field Reports, often users post what are essentially diaries, giving a rundown of the night without any focus on actual techniques used. For instance:\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;gt;I went to the starbucks today, and smiled at cashier, but got too nervous to say anything so I just left.\\n\\n*This doesn't do anything to help someone get laid or work towards a relationship*. Something better might include some introspection about what exactly you did, particularly after you corrected the mistake and got better results.\\n\\nShare positive value with the community, this keeps the sub filled with useful material! Remember to add the **Field Report** flair to your post!\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Links to Articles / Videos**\\n\\nThere are tons of great blogs, vlogs, podcast, forums, and articles about seduction, and we love to stay up to date on what is out there in the community. Post these if you find them useful! **But remember that you must still have body text in your post summarizing the content you are linking!**\\n\\n*However, if the video is more about fun (like approaching while holding a dildo), it might be removed* because it isn't a good example of actually helping Sedditors hook up, etc.\\n\\nAlso, videos of friend-zoned guys or guys bad at pickup will probably not be allowed, as they violate the golden rule of \"Does this post help someone get laid or land a relationship?\"\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Sharing Techniques**\\n\\nIf you have come up with your own techniques, SHARE THEM!!!. We rely on the community for new approaches and ideas, just make sure they are field tested with at least 20 approaches.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Asking specific questions or basic questions**\\n\\nWhile the subreddit can become clogged with questions like \"How do I approach\" or \"How do I kiss someone?\", more advanced topics can provide a rich discussion. Examples:\\n\\n1. How do I manage dating multiple people?\\n2. What's the best way to increase my chances of a one night stand?\\n3. Best way to arrange a threesome?\\n4. Struggling with a specific aspect of inner-game\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 3.) Common Inappropriate Posts\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Overly Beginner Topics**\\n\\nThings like:\\n\\n1. How do I approach\\n2. How do I get a number\\n3. I'm in college, how do I talk to girls/boys\\n4. How to kiss someone\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Physical Limitation**\\n\\nThere have been plenty of posts on [**Why Looks Don't Matter**](  **But this is oversimplifying the matter.**\\n\\nThe truth is, looks are just part of the picture. So they matter, but other things do, too. \\*Game\" can compensate for looks if one has the social skills and hasn't given up.\\n\\nAnd at the end of the day, seduction is a form of social interaction and physical appearance is not a social skill.\\* If you have good looks but no game, you lose. If you have good game without the best looks, you can still get a good result.\\n\\n* **Will this work for me? I'm depressed and/or awkward**\\n\\nShort answer: YES!!!\\n\\nMany of the guys that have transformed their lives started as some of the most awkward, hard case, forever alone people you have ever met.\\n\\nNote: this subreddit is not a substitute for therapy, which is one of the most underrated tools available to combat depression, anxiety, etc. If you haven't tried this, it's worth a try, especially methods like [group therapy](  or [cognitive behavioral therapy]( \\n\\nStudy the sidebar and Seddit history as best you can, and if you are struggling after 3 months of serious work, then you can post about what specifically isn't working. Don't make a post until you've put in the foundational reading and work in.\\n\\nAnd again, if it's a basic question, post at /r/askseddit.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Asking for Advice**\\n\\n~~Any calls for specific situational advice with a specific female should be directed to~~ r/askSeddit~~. Note that is askSEDDIT, not askREDDIT.~~\\n\\n~~It exists to give you a place where sedditors can answer your questions without bogging down the frontpage of~~ r/seduction~~.~~\\n\\n(While we used to have a venue for these kinds of specific questions, AskSeddit was taken down without notice. **We may have to re-establish a Basic Questions thread but that will have to wait for now.**)\\n\\n*The problem with specific topics is they are specific to YOUR situation, while broad pickup topics are applicable to EVERY guys situation.* We have about 736k subscribers, and the focus of this sub is to help everyone.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Rage Comics / Failure links**\\n\\nIn short, things like rage comics, stuff about forever alone guys or friend-zoned losers are not appropriate, and will be deleted. Simply making fun of the community or guys that aren't good with women does nothing to HELP guys with women.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Advertisement or Solicitations**\\n\\n**Seddit is not an advertisement forum. Soliciting for, or advertising products and/or services, is not allowed here.** And any information posted should be aimed at helping progress our member's abilities in the arts of seduction. *A specific reason why the link is helpful to sedditors should be accompanied in the post or in a comment.*\\n\\nLinks should be made to actual content, rather than advertising a book or promoting a website's homepage. Any blatant advertisement of products that cost money without prior approval from moderators can be met with deletion.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 4.) Other Inappropriate Topics\\n\\nThis is **not** the venue for:\\n\\n* Debates about:\\n   * Whether looks matter or not\\n   * Vaccines\\n   * Nofap\\n   * Pseudoscience\\n   * Any topic that would require wading through research papers to have a productive, informed conversation.\\n* Conspiracy topics\\n* Posts or comments that boil down to arguing over semantics. \\n   * Arguing that the friend-zone doesn't exist\\n   * Arguing for a new definition of *a word that's already defined in the dictionary.*\\n* **Shit-posting, rants, or** [**circlejerk**](  **posts**\\n* Attacking (flaming) any member will get either a warning or a ban at the moderators discretion.\\n* Calling any member a rapist, insinuating anything negative about their character because they practice seduction, or just plain name calling are all forbidden.\\n* The \"don't ask a fish\" argument is tired. If you have a point about someone's bad advice, debunk the bad advice on its own merits.\\n* Policing what dating goals a person should have is also out of bounds.\\n   * Judging whether or not people should want a relationship or not.\\n   * Judging whether or not people should go after someone who is taken or not.\\n   * Judging people according to your sense of morality in general, or slut-shaming specifically.\\n* **If you think a comment isn't helpful or breaks the rules, then report it to the moderators.** Do not engage with the person posting or commenting.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# 5.) Celebrity / Industry AMAs\\n\\nPlease contact and schedule these through moderators. We maintain a numbered list of Official AMA's, and for inclusion you must schedule with moderators.\\n\\nFurthermore, AMAs are often the source of flaming and attacks from hostile subreddits, so we schedule moderators to be online for the AMA to control these. If these are not scheduled through the mod team and these attacks occur, the entire thread might get removed.\\n\\n**All AMA's must follow the Reddit standard:**\\n\\n1. Questions are answered in real time, not hours later. Make the AMA when you will be at the keyboard.\\n2. Questions must be answered on Reddit, in the thread. Not YouTube, not on a blog.\\n3.

They're fantastic lie detectors and they can tell as easily as you can when someone's behaving desperately or inauthentically to get something from them. They're going to view leaning on a bar with them with the same skepticism and contempt that you would view a used car salesman with. \\n\\nAnd yeah, maybe if you went into the dealership *looking* to leave with shitty used car and accepting the grift, you'd tolerate their bs. In the same way, you *can* probably approach 100 women and find the one who would've said yes to anyone who asked meeting their minimum standards, but is that *really* what you want? Does that make you feel *good* about who you are? Was the drunk, flat, emotionally distant, jizz into latex worth a night of behaving like a jackass towards people who mostly have contempt for you and clearly see that you view them as an antagonistic force to be tricked in some kind of game?\\n\\nWhat's the solution? **Be authentic, drop \"pick up art,\" and be someone who you're proud to be.**\\n\\nLet's face it. Most of you are presenting facades of yourself to women because you're ashamed of yourself. Most of you are also seeking out pick up because you see being chosen for sex as validating to your deep insecurities and feelings of rejection and unworthiness.\\n\\nThe women who will fuck you with passion like your cock contained the elixir of life, a woman who will love you for who you are, *will only respect you when you respect yourself*, and they can mostly tell. Even if you manage to fake it through a night, they'll figure you out and either ghost you or have contempt for you through a stagnant relationship.\\n\\nAnyone will tell you, **confidence is the key** to being respected. But where does confidence come from? Confidence comes from doing hard things. Things that you might fail at but you do them anyways because they're meaningful.\\n\\n* Take a martial art\\n* Learn a new skill in a new community, like a cooking class or something\\n* Join meetups or a sport you've never played\\n* Work on your mental wellness and go meditate or see a therapist\\n* Connect with family you've had difficulty with\\n* Take a job that challenges you more\\n* Do something you've always dreamed of but been afraid to do\\n\\nWhen you do hard things, even if you struggle, even if you fail, you *will* feel proud with the right mindset.\\n\\nThink about the difference in how conversations go with someone who's challenging themselves, vs someone who is taking the easy path in life.\\n\\nNot taking difficult risks: \"Everything's great, I closed some important deals and  I feel like I'm really ahead for next week, maybe I'll take a day off. Glad to be here now, this is such a fun club!\"\\n\\n**vs**\\n\\nTaking difficult risks: \"It's been challenging, but I feel hopeful. I reached out to my brother who I haven't talked to in years since his wife yelled at my kid and he defended her behaviour. It felt strange talking to him and not knowing whats going on in his life, I've really missed him\"\\n\\nor\\n\\n\"Fun but tough, I just got out of my 6th Aikido class and everyone else there has been doing it for years, so I feel pretty uncoordinated. I'm really connecting with people there, though, and I'm really trying to find humility in being constantly schooled  and thrown to the ground by college freshmen half my size.\"\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThink how much more interested you'd be in connecting to the second or third person over the first.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**You are now:**\\n\\n* Talking to someone about something that's extremely interesting and emotionally tractable because your life has the conflict and excitement of challenge\\n* Demonstrating your courage and will, your dedication to doing what's meaningful over what's easy\\n* Being vulnerable in a way which reflects favorably on you, opens the door for them to respond with something emotionally vulnerable about themselves, for you to validate each other, and for you to really connect.\\n* Doing so in a way that will stand up to scrutiny, because it's real\\n* And furthermore, you're expanding your network and meeting a lot more women in prolonged interactions that aren't just hitting on them in bars. \\n\\nYou can't fake confidence. When you talk about your struggles with doing something difficult, you open yourself up to real connection that people respect. It allows you to humble brag, to show you care about improving yourself, and opens the door for reciprocity from them.\\n\\nIf you think of **ANY** story, movies, books, whatever, stories land with us when they connect authentically with reality in some way and contain characters who are changed by struggle and adversity. Even comedies and cartoons. Your life's story needs to be this if you ever want to feel good about yourself.\\n\\nWhen you prioritize authenticity, you're also treating women like humans who are smart, and worthy of sharing your true self with. Give respect, get respect. And come across as confident and not thinly guarding insecurities. They can tell.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe thing about being authentic, vulnerable and challenging yourself, is that you'll find yourself just feeling proud, and might fall into a long term relationship with someone who respects your boundaries, shares your interests and meets your sexual needs. You'll have the confidence to be with women you actually respect and admire. Or you'll develop lots of satisfying flings with people you share struggles with. The side effect of being proud and having authentic and intimate connections who hold you up is that you won't feel the need to engage in this PUA shit anymore.\\n\\nThe irony is that the more you focus on pick up game as a sport or a game, the worse you actually get at connecting. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nChallenge yourself, be vulnerable, humanize women, maintain firm boundaries, and unjoin this sub. You won't need it.</td>\n","      <td>Yamochao</td>\n","      <td>yfxnih</td>\n","      <td>2022-10-28 19:05:04</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yfxnih/the_last_post_youll_need_to_read_here_just_do/</td>\n","      <td>1.00</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1213</th>\n","      <td>Should I be concerned with how she's replying?</td>\n","      <td>Hey everyone,\\n\\nI really like this girl, but I am pretty sure she doesn't feel the same based on how she's replying.

October 29th. UK. \\n\\n2 Days before Halloween (so plenty of Halloween costumes and Halloween theme going on)\\n\\nI'm 36. Male. Introvert(ish). Struggle with SA. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCracked a can of carling, did a bit of grooming, threw on a nice top and jeans and a spritz of cologne before heading out. \\n\\nWent to the bus stop. 3 girls, early 20's (one is crazy fit, one is beer goggle fit, and one is slowly becoming a land whale) already waiting for the bus. Before I even check the timetable one girl tells me it's 17 mins away so I get the feeling they must have at least been intrigued by physicality (I exercise regularly). I start talking to them but they start to get a bit cold on me. I clumsily say something about getting to hang out with three beautiful women while waiting for the bus.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe make small talk but they don't seem that interested. There are silences but I don't awkwardly start trying to create a conversation. One girl is nice, one girl is passive and the third girl is sending me bitch vibes. I ignore it for the most part.\\n\\nI ask a \"deep\" question and bitchy girl tries to call me out on it. I calmly respond that it's not like we're ever gonna see each other again so why not, it's at least more interesting than elevator conversation.\\n\\nBitch lady tries to undermine me yet again by asking if I'm going out alone. I tell her I'm late and heading to a group of people at a bar (technically I'm going out alone, but I am heading to a bar for a meet up group of people I've never met).\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe get on the bus. I make a bit of conversation, ask a few questions, try and generate a bit of push and pull but they just seem disinterested in me so they keep trying to drag me into their frame control. They partly succeed because I kind of did simp a bit on them towards the end of the bus ride, when we get off I get the feeling they want to get away from me so I so I regain the frame by stopping them and say thanks for the company and wish them a good night.\\n\\nNine out of ten times in the past that poor encounter would have sunk me into a deep dark thought pattern and I'd ruminate about it all night. Not this time. I let that failed encounter pass through me like a ghost (still annoying because I wasn't rude, nor was I acting \"beta\"). They just wouldn't give me a chance to demonstrate value, have a chat and a laugh while killing time with me while waiting for the bus.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo I get to the bar for a meet up group. Grab a beer. Stand around awkwardly for a bit trying to find someone to say hi to and generate a conversation with but nobody really giving me an invitation to join their circles of conversation.\\n\\nA girl walks in (part of the meet up group) and I start talking to her but it doesn't go well. Just a clunky conversation but I'm not attracted to her so it doesn't phase me too much. In fact I recognize that she's actually the one being socially \"difficult\" and awkward with me rather than the other way around.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI move on to another group and sit down, have a chat but the guy is really drunk and keeps talk-spitting in my face so I wait for a que and slide around to talk to another girl. It's a better conversation but I'm not that into her and I played it perhaps a bit too \"cool\" by never really answering her questions about where I'm from or what I do.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI get bored of her and excuse myself. I hit the bar to get another drink. While waiting I make small talk with a pretty girl dressed as a fire warden (although I mistake her for a construction worker) who's ordering drinks for what I must assume is a group of her friends. I make a joke about one of the drinks being for me but it doesn't really land. I ask what's she looking for tonight hoping she'll ask me the same question and I can say something along the lines of looking to laugh, dance and find a spark. She leaves, I brush it off. Get my drink, head back to the meet up group. I spot 40-50 year old woman on her own and chat with her for a bit. I'm not interested in her but it's better than standing around not talking to anyone. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMAIN ENCOUNTER:\\n\\nWhile talking to her I spot a girl on her own, filming the group on her phone. I approach. Ask if she's part of the group. She says no. So I teasingly accuse her of being a spy. She laughs. We start talking and it's all very natural. I make her laugh a lot, she makes me laugh. We discuss a variety of topics. Turns out she looks 25, but is a 35 year Muslim girl from Turkey who drinks, smokes, poly-am, bisexual who's here for 2 months as part of academic research.\\n\\nShe finishes her a drink I offer to get her another one.\\n\\nI lead, take charge and decide we should sit down in a corner together.\\n\\nWe flirt, laugh, drink and end up making out for a while.\\n\\nI tell her we should keep on partying and go to the coolest place in town, her bedroom. She thinks it's super fun but she can't because she lives with her academic supervisor. She asks if we can go back to my place (full disclosure I'm currently living at my aunt's place and I'm honest about it to her). We make out, cuddle. She even slides into my chest and closes her eyes. After a minute of this she decides we can go back to her place as her supervisor is gone for a week.\\n\\nWe head for a taxi but she wants to take a bus back to save me the taxi fair (how awesome is this girl!). Anyways I take charge and we grab a taxi (it was literally cheaper than the bus anyways).\\n\\nAnyways, we get back to hers. Open a can of G&amp;amp;T and have one sip before getting to the bedroom.\\n\\nSex was great. I know I made her orgasm. She's bloody loud too, which is always appreciated.\\n\\nLiterally after we finish having sex she asks if I want to go or stay. I say I want to stay. I suspect she was feeling lonely, homesick and wanted to feel the presence of a man in her life, someone to cuddle up against in bed, and I just happened to be the right person at the right time.\\n\\nThe next day she seemed a bit more cold and distant to me, at least at first, but I think she received some work/uni emails that stressed her out. We have a coffee, talk for a bit and I leave.\\n\\nWe'll probs meet up again. maybe for a hook up, maybe just to hang out, she's bisexual and doesn't really believe in LTR's so there's always that wonderful potential that we might go out and find a girl for a three way without it getting too serious between us.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPS! we've added each other on IG and literally one minute after posting a story she's peeked at it so something tells me she's still at least somewhat into me.</td>\n","      <td>NunyaBidnizz68</td>\n","      <td>yhnzta</td>\n","      <td>2022-10-30 19:48:44</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yhnzta/halloween_saturday_sorry_for_the_long_read/</td>\n","      <td>1.00</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-ccb1b6c4-fc4b-4710-8b84-3d6f59524396')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-ccb1b6c4-fc4b-4710-8b84-3d6f59524396 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

I'm a big believer of AMS's saying \"She either likes what she sees or she doesn't\" and I basically just say that I find her attractive and ask for her number. Initally, I wanted to approach 100 to get a good sample size, but apparently it's very hard for me to find a woman I think is attractive enough, maybe I'm aiming too high. \\n\\nHere are the various responses I got and this should serve as motivation that it's very rare that a girl tells you to fuck off or similar. \\n\\nFacts about me: germany, 24, black, 181/182 cm (about 6 feet), thinning or receding hairline but i have a head full of hair, shaved face, very skinny 64 kg (will join gym next year again but will surely quit again since even 3500 calories gets me only to 67 kg, sedentary lifestyle, extreme hardgainer),\\n\\n\\#1 This was on a shopping street and a woman in her 30s was walking with her female friend. She told me \"sorry, i have a bf\".\\n\\n\\#2 This girl just looks at me, ignores me and passes me\\n\\n\\#3 I caught her looking at me (i think so) through the window of a cafe and I entered it, but she completely ignores me when I start to talk to her.\\n\\n\\#4 This girl just straight up tells me \"no\".\\n\\n\\#5 this young black woman in her 20s was chilling with another female black friend and she just shakes her head. Later on when I was looking for the next to approach she kinda follows me with her friend and she obviously told her friend to come speak to me. The friend said to me \"You wanted her number?\". No offense, but in general my preference are white /hispanic / middle eastern women and I approached her because the girl looked decent, but I can take it or leave it. I just said to her \"No, there are 1000 women, it's alright\" or something like that.

I'm a big believer of AMS's saying \"She either likes what she sees or she doesn't\" and I basically just say that I find her attractive and ask for her number. Initally, I wanted to approach 100 to get a good sample size, but apparently it's very hard for me to find a woman I think is attractive enough, maybe I'm aiming too high. \\n\\nHere are the various responses I got and this should serve as motivation that it's very rare that a girl tells you to fuck off or similar. \\n\\nFacts about me: germany, 24, black, 181/182 cm (about 6 feet), thinning or receding hairline but i have a head full of hair, shaved face, very skinny 64 kg (will join gym next year again but will surely quit again since even 3500 calories gets me only to 67 kg, sedentary lifestyle, extreme hardgainer),\\n\\n\\#1 This was on a shopping street and a woman in her 30s was walking with her female friend. She told me \"sorry, i have a bf\".\\n\\n\\#2 This girl just looks at me, ignores me and passes me\\n\\n\\#3 I caught her looking at me (i think so) through the window of a cafe and I entered it, but she completely ignores me when I start to talk to her.\\n\\n\\#4 This girl just straight up tells me \"no\".\\n\\n\\#5 this young black woman in her 20s was chilling with another female black friend and she just shakes her head. Later on when I was looking for the next to approach she kinda follows me with her friend and she obviously told her friend to come speak to me. The friend said to me \"You wanted her number?\". No offense, but in general my preference are white /hispanic / middle eastern women and I approached her because the girl looked decent, but I can take it or leave it. I just said to her \"No, there are 1000 women, it's alright\" or something like that. I have no clue what would have happened if she gave me her number, maybe she would have ghosted or never replied to my message, maybe she found it funny and wanted to play games with me or we could have married, haha, but there is plenty of fish in the sea and maybe I should approach more black women ;) I count this approach as success.\\n\\n\\#6 This girl just shakes her head after speaking to her\\n\\n\\#7 She told me it was nice of me but she is married and has 1 kid.\\n\\n\\#8 this girl tells me \"no, sorry!\"\\n\\n\\#9 this black girl just shakes her head\\n\\n\\#10 she just straight up tells me \"no\"\\n\\n\\#11 i believe she was russian and just tells me \"no\"\\n\\n\\#12 this was in the train and she told me \"sorry, i have a bf\"\\n\\n\\#13 this girl also tells me \"i have a bf\"\\n\\n\\#14 i was sitting next to this girl in train and she tells me \"no\"\\n\\nThe following was at a subway station\\n\\n\\#15 no\\n\\n\\#16 no\\n\\n\\#17 no\\n\\n\\#18 no\\n\\nOutside again\\n\\n\\#19 just shakes her head\\n\\n\\#20 this girl tells me \"I don't give my number\" out, i just take it as rejection and move on\\n\\n\\#21 she just tells me no\\n\\n\\#22 this girl says \"surely not\". this was by far the meanest rejection of that day :(\\n\\n\\#23 she just tells me no\\n\\n\\#24 she just tells me no aswell\\n\\n\\#25 this woman doesn't even look me in the eye and ignored me\\n\\n\\#26 this one tells me \"no, i have a bf\".\\n\\nTo be honest, it sucks so much especially if you see all those girls in crop tops and short clothes and stuff and I don't masturbate at all.

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After  minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill!   Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed.   Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly. I still have a lot to learn since I'm not getting kissed or laid any time soon, but I'll get there I'm sure   \n","4   I’ve made around  approaches since moving to my new city last year but only gotten laid twice. I approach in a respectful way and almost always get a good reaction, but have a lot of trouble with flaking after getting the number/IG.   Not to be a douche but I am also told I am attractive very often, and everyone in my social circle thinks I’m a player who gets a lot of girls. It’s frustrating living this double life where I’m the only one who knows I’m not nearly as successful as I apparently comes across. Especially as I really just want a loving connection with a woman who I am genuinely interested in and attracted to (not to be a douche again, but someone on my level of physical attractiveness, intelligent, and kind hearted).  I’ve let the realization of the gap between my efforts and my results kill the excitement that came with the first major steps of learning game. I don’t know what my problem is, so I’d appreciate any actionable feedback or criticisms.

They hit me up to chat or whatever, are flirty through text, but are always busy when I ask them out.  I realized I often am the \"attention guy\" and that's it. I need to cut my losses and move on. And when I do begin to move on, they start texting me more and double texting, perhaps trying to lure me back? I fall for it. Eventually, ask them out again. And another excuse of busy or whatever. I need to stop.  But anyways, why do girls do this?? Is it true they love attention the same way we love blowjobs? There's many women we'd probably have a fling with, but we wouldn't really want anything more serious. Are women the similar in a way? They love some guys' attention but don't want anything more than that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n","6   has anyone noticed that dudes who have addiction problems never have issues getting a gf? I've got two cousins, one used to slay in his early s but he's turned into a lazy slob that never leaves the room and is alone. He doesn't have drug addiction problems but he eats like shit. Meanwhile, my other cousing was a virgin gamer/geek all through his 's but a few years ago he got a GF who he's been with ever since and unfortunately he's struggling with a serious durg addiction problem.   I started thinking and it's something I realized is that every guy I've met who has drug addiction problems never has an issue with women. I mean, he's not always dating the hottest women on the planet but he never has issues finding someone. Sure, he can't keep a job, he's bouncing off the walls at home but finding love is never ever a problem for him. Meanwhile, a lot of guys I work with who are very button down, discliplined and healthy, they are very anti-drug, hard working, ex-military type men in their late 's 's, show up to work every day on time and will stay back if asked, they are all **alone**. They live alone in their small apartment. Some of them have plans to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle finding a woman locally.   Why is it that men who live healthy, disclplined lifestyles, always walking the straight and narrow struggle with women while guys who are drug addicted mess always have a partner? irrespective of looks.                                                                           \n","13   I just got back from meeting up with a girl for drinks tonight.

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After  minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill!   Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed.   Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly. I still have a lot to learn since I'm not getting kissed or laid any time soon, but I'll get there I'm sure</td>\n","      <td>Forward_Noise1342</td>\n","      <td>xsh3gu</td>\n","      <td>2022-10-01 00:23:12</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsh3gu/im_no_longer_introverted_it_clicked_in_me_today/</td>\n","      <td>1.00</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Blind Spots</td>\n","      <td>I’ve made around  approaches since moving to my new city last year but only gotten laid twice.

It’s frustrating living this double life where I’m the only one who knows I’m not nearly as successful as I apparently comes across. Especially as I really just want a loving connection with a woman who I am genuinely interested in and attracted to (not to be a douche again, but someone on my level of physical attractiveness, intelligent, and kind hearted).  I’ve let the realization of the gap between my efforts and my results kill the excitement that came with the first major steps of learning game.

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill! Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed. Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly. I still have a lot to learn since I'm not getting kissed or laid any time soon, but I'll get there I'm sure   \n","4   I’ve made around approaches since moving to my new city last year but only gotten laid twice. I approach in a respectful way and almost always get a good reaction, but have a lot of trouble with flaking after getting the number/IG. Not to be a douche but I am also told I am attractive very often, and everyone in my social circle thinks I’m a player who gets a lot of girls. It’s frustrating living this double life where I’m the only one who knows I’m not nearly as successful as I apparently comes across. Especially as I really just want a loving connection with a woman who I am genuinely interested in and attracted to (not to be a douche again, but someone on my level of physical attractiveness, intelligent, and kind hearted). I’ve let the realization of the gap between my efforts and my results kill the excitement that came with the first major steps of learning game. I don’t know what my problem is, so I’d appreciate any actionable feedback or criticisms. Thank you 🙏                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","5   I find myself texting / talking to girls for far too long, failing to escalate to a date. They hit me up to chat or whatever, are flirty through text, but are always busy when I ask them out. I realized I often am the attention guy and that's it. I need to cut my losses and move on. And when I do begin to move on, they start texting me more and double texting, perhaps trying to lure me back? I fall for it. Eventually, ask them out again. And another excuse of busy or whatever. I need to stop. But anyways, why do girls do this?? Is it true they love attention the same way we love blowjobs? There's many women we'd probably have a fling with, but we wouldn't really want anything more serious. Are women the similar in a way? They love some guys' attention but don't want anything more than that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","6   has anyone noticed that dudes who have addiction problems never have issues getting a gf? I've got two cousins, one used to slay in his early s but he's turned into a lazy slob that never leaves the room and is alone. He doesn't have drug addiction problems but he eats like shit. Meanwhile, my other cousing was a virgin gamer/geek all through his 's but a few years ago he got a GF who he's been with ever since and unfortunately he's struggling with a serious durg addiction problem. I started thinking and it's something I realized is that every guy I've met who has drug addiction problems never has an issue with women. I mean, he's not always dating the hottest women on the planet but he never has issues finding someone. Sure, he can't keep a job, he's bouncing off the walls at home but finding love is never ever a problem for him. Meanwhile, a lot of guys I work with who are very button down, discliplined and healthy, they are very anti-drug, hard working, ex-military type men in their late 's 's, show up to work every day on time and will stay back if asked, they are all **alone**. They live alone in their small apartment. Some of them have plans to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle finding a woman locally. Why is it that men who live healthy, disclplined lifestyles, always walking the straight and narrow struggle with women while guys who are drug addicted mess always have a partner? irrespective of looks.                                                                          \n","13  I just got back from meeting up with a girl for drinks tonight. She was nice and we hang out for minutes or so, she's laughing and from my perspective the vibes are good. Then all of a sudden her friends run into her in the bar. I'm roped into their friend group and minutes later she tells me she's going with her friends so they can drive her home. They leave the bar together. What do I make of this? My assumption is that they were just hanging out close by and she decided she had enough of me and bailed. I've been on like first dates from hinge and none of them have ever done something like this. Made me feel like a predator or something when I didn't even touch her and was just being friendly.

I mean , he be not always date the hot woman on the planet but he never have issue find someone . sure , he can not keep a job , he be bounce off the wall at home but find love be never ever a problem for he . meanwhile , a lot of guy I work with who be very button down , disclipline and healthy , they be very anti - drug , hard working , ex - military type man in their late 's 's , show up to work every day on time and will stay back if ask , they be all * * alone * * . they live alone in their small apartment . some of they have plan to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle find a woman locally . why be it that man who live healthy , disclplined lifestyle , always walk the straight and narrow struggle with woman while guy who be drug addict mess always have a partner ? irrespective of look .                                        \n","13   I just get back from meet up with a girl for drink tonight . she be nice and we hang out for minute or so , she be laugh and from my perspective the vibe be good . then all of a sudden her friend run into she in the bar .

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill! Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed.

They live alone in their small apartment. Some of them have plans to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle finding a woman locally.

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill! Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed. Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly. I still have a lot to learn since I'm not getting kissed or laid any time soon, but I'll get there I'm sure   \n","\n","              author      id          created_utc  \\\n","1  Forward_Noise1342  xsh3gu  2022-10-01 00:23:12   \n","\n","                                                                                                   URL  \\\n","1  https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsh3gu/im_no_longer_introverted_it_clicked_in_me_today/   \n","\n","   upvote_ratio  num_awards  \\\n","1  1.0           0            \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               SpacyLemma  \\\n","1   something click in I today .. early I go and cold approach a pretty woman who be sit at a bench wait for her friend , ask if she would mind if I sit next to she and she say no , so I sit and start talk to she , and we have a good conversation go on ! after minute of talking , I have to leave , so I leave , and do not bother ask for her number or anything , despite the IOI 's I get , I just do not feel like ask for it .. mainly because that be prob the only time we would meet , anyways . during that whole thing , my heart be not race , I be relaxed , and I be interested in engage in a convo with she .. at that moment , it be like I break through the bottleneck I been stick on , which be gain confidence and be chill ! go to a table of girl and a few dude I never talk to during lunch , I ask if they want to play uno , and we get to play .

Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed. Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly. I still have a lot to learn since I'm not getting kissed or laid any time soon, but I'll get there I'm sure   \n","4   I’ve made around approaches since moving to my new city last year but only gotten laid twice. I approach in a respectful way and almost always get a good reaction, but have a lot of trouble with flaking after getting the number/IG. Not to be a douche but I am also told I am attractive very often, and everyone in my social circle thinks I’m a player who gets a lot of girls. It’s frustrating living this double life where I’m the only one who knows I’m not nearly as successful as I apparently comes across. Especially as I really just want a loving connection with a woman who I am genuinely interested in and attracted to (not to be a douche again, but someone on my level of physical attractiveness, intelligent, and kind hearted). I’ve let the realization of the gap between my efforts and my results kill the excitement that came with the first major steps of learning game. I don’t know what my problem is, so I’d appreciate any actionable feedback or criticisms.

They hit me up to chat or whatever, are flirty through text, but are always busy when I ask them out. I realized I often am the attention guy and that's it. I need to cut my losses and move on. And when I do begin to move on, they start texting me more and double texting, perhaps trying to lure me back? I fall for it. Eventually, ask them out again. And another excuse of busy or whatever. I need to stop. But anyways, why do girls do this?? Is it true they love attention the same way we love blowjobs? There's many women we'd probably have a fling with, but we wouldn't really want anything more serious. Are women the similar in a way?

I've got two cousins, one used to slay in his early s but he's turned into a lazy slob that never leaves the room and is alone. He doesn't have drug addiction problems but he eats like shit. Meanwhile, my other cousing was a virgin gamer/geek all through his 's but a few years ago he got a GF who he's been with ever since and unfortunately he's struggling with a serious durg addiction problem. I started thinking and it's something I realized is that every guy I've met who has drug addiction problems never has an issue with women. I mean, he's not always dating the hottest women on the planet but he never has issues finding someone. Sure, he can't keep a job, he's bouncing off the walls at home but finding love is never ever a problem for him. Meanwhile, a lot of guys I work with who are very button down, discliplined and healthy, they are very anti-drug, hard working, ex-military type men in their late 's 's, show up to work every day on time and will stay back if asked, they are all **alone**. They live alone in their small apartment. Some of them have plans to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle finding a woman locally. Why is it that men who live healthy, disclplined lifestyles, always walking the straight and narrow struggle with women while guys who are drug addicted mess always have a partner? irrespective of looks.                                                                          \n","13  I just got back from meeting up with a girl for drinks tonight. She was nice and we hang out for minutes or so, she's laughing and from my perspective the vibes are good. Then all of a sudden her friends run into her in the bar. I'm roped into their friend group and minutes later she tells me she's going with her friends so they can drive her home. They leave the bar together. What do I make of this? My assumption is that they were just hanging out close by and she decided she had enough of me and bailed. I've been on like first dates from hinge and none of them have ever done something like this. Made me feel like a predator or something when I didn't even touch her and was just being friendly. Idk I'm just venting at this point. Never felt so shitty after a date lol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n","\n","               author      id          created_utc  \\\n","1   Forward_Noise1342  xsh3gu  2022-10-01 00:23:12   \n","4   psychicblasterr    xsi5cd  2022-10-01 01:13:19   \n","5   eatmypekpek        xsjs63  2022-10-01 02:33:50   \n","6   ThisBeCat          xsk11x  2022-10-01 02:46:32   \n","13  Bmiller1550        xsmk96  2022-10-01 04:59:04   \n","\n","                                                                                                      URL  \\\n","1   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsh3gu/im_no_longer_introverted_it_clicked_in_me_today/     \n","4   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsi5cd/blind_spots/                                         \n","5   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsjs63/is_it_true_that_girls_love_attention_the_same_way/   \n","6   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsk11x/drug_abuse_gets_you_laid_has_anyone_noticed_this/    \n","13  https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsmk96/just_had_the_worst_hinge_date_of_my_life/            \n","\n","    upvote_ratio  num_awards  \\\n","1   1.00          0            \n","4   0.92          0            \n","5   1.00          0            \n","6   1.00          0            \n","13  1.00          0            \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                SpacyLemma  \\\n","1    something click in I today .. early I go and cold approach a pretty woman who be sit at a bench wait for her friend , ask if she would mind if I sit next to she and she say no , so I sit and start talk to she , and we have a good conversation go on ! after minute of talking , I have to leave , so I leave , and do not bother ask for her number or anything , despite the IOI 's I get , I just do not feel like ask for it .. mainly because that be prob the only time we would meet , anyways . during that whole thing , my heart be not race , I be relaxed , and I be interested in engage in a convo with she .. at that moment , it be like I break through the bottleneck I been stick on , which be gain confidence and be chill ! go to a table of girl and a few dude I never talk to during lunch , I ask if they want to play uno , and we get to play .

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill! Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed. Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly.

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill! Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed. Thank you everyone, your knowledge and different perspectives have aided me greatly. I still have a lot to learn since I'm not getting kissed or laid any time soon, but I'll get there I'm sure   \n","4   I’ve made around approaches since moving to my new city last year but only gotten laid twice. I approach in a respectful way and almost always get a good reaction, but have a lot of trouble with flaking after getting the number/IG. Not to be a douche but I am also told I am attractive very often, and everyone in my social circle thinks I’m a player who gets a lot of girls. It’s frustrating living this double life where I’m the only one who knows I’m not nearly as successful as I apparently comes across. Especially as I really just want a loving connection with a woman who I am genuinely interested in and attracted to (not to be a douche again, but someone on my level of physical attractiveness, intelligent, and kind hearted). I’ve let the realization of the gap between my efforts and my results kill the excitement that came with the first major steps of learning game. I don’t know what my problem is, so I’d appreciate any actionable feedback or criticisms. Thank you 🙏                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","5   I find myself texting / talking to girls for far too long, failing to escalate to a date. They hit me up to chat or whatever, are flirty through text, but are always busy when I ask them out. I realized I often am the attention guy and that's it. I need to cut my losses and move on. And when I do begin to move on, they start texting me more and double texting, perhaps trying to lure me back? I fall for it. Eventually, ask them out again. And another excuse of busy or whatever. I need to stop. But anyways, why do girls do this?? Is it true they love attention the same way we love blowjobs? There's many women we'd probably have a fling with, but we wouldn't really want anything more serious. Are women the similar in a way? They love some guys' attention but don't want anything more than that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","6   has anyone noticed that dudes who have addiction problems never have issues getting a gf? I've got two cousins, one used to slay in his early s but he's turned into a lazy slob that never leaves the room and is alone. He doesn't have drug addiction problems but he eats like shit. Meanwhile, my other cousing was a virgin gamer/geek all through his 's but a few years ago he got a GF who he's been with ever since and unfortunately he's struggling with a serious durg addiction problem. I started thinking and it's something I realized is that every guy I've met who has drug addiction problems never has an issue with women. I mean, he's not always dating the hottest women on the planet but he never has issues finding someone. Sure, he can't keep a job, he's bouncing off the walls at home but finding love is never ever a problem for him. Meanwhile, a lot of guys I work with who are very button down, discliplined and healthy, they are very anti-drug, hard working, ex-military type men in their late 's 's, show up to work every day on time and will stay back if asked, they are all **alone**. They live alone in their small apartment. Some of them have plans to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle finding a woman locally. Why is it that men who live healthy, disclplined lifestyles, always walking the straight and narrow struggle with women while guys who are drug addicted mess always have a partner? irrespective of looks.                                                                          \n","13  I just got back from meeting up with a girl for drinks tonight. She was nice and we hang out for minutes or so, she's laughing and from my perspective the vibes are good. Then all of a sudden her friends run into her in the bar. I'm roped into their friend group and minutes later she tells me she's going with her friends so they can drive her home. They leave the bar together. What do I make of this? My assumption is that they were just hanging out close by and she decided she had enough of me and bailed. I've been on like first dates from hinge and none of them have ever done something like this. Made me feel like a predator or something when I didn't even touch her and was just being friendly. Idk I'm just venting at this point. Never felt so shitty after a date lol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n","\n","               author      id          created_utc  \\\n","1   Forward_Noise1342  xsh3gu  2022-10-01 00:23:12   \n","4   psychicblasterr    xsi5cd  2022-10-01 01:13:19   \n","5   eatmypekpek        xsjs63  2022-10-01 02:33:50   \n","6   ThisBeCat          xsk11x  2022-10-01 02:46:32   \n","13  Bmiller1550        xsmk96  2022-10-01 04:59:04   \n","\n","                                                                                                      URL  \\\n","1   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsh3gu/im_no_longer_introverted_it_clicked_in_me_today/     \n","4   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsi5cd/blind_spots/                                         \n","5   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsjs63/is_it_true_that_girls_love_attention_the_same_way/   \n","6   https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsk11x/drug_abuse_gets_you_laid_has_anyone_noticed_this/    \n","13  https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xsmk96/just_had_the_worst_hinge_date_of_my_life/            \n","\n","    upvote_ratio  num_awards  \\\n","1   1.00          0            \n","4   0.92          0            \n","5   1.00          0            \n","6   1.00          0            \n","13  1.00          0            \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                SpacyLemma  \\\n","1    something click in I today .. early I go and cold approach a pretty woman who be sit at a bench wait for her friend , ask if she would mind if I sit next to she and she say no , so I sit and start talk to she , and we have a good conversation go on ! after minute of talking , I have to leave , so I leave , and do not bother ask for her number or anything , despite the IOI 's I get , I just do not feel like ask for it .. mainly because that be prob the only time we would meet , anyways . during that whole thing , my heart be not race , I be relaxed , and I be interested in engage in a convo with she .. at that moment , it be like I break through the bottleneck I been stick on , which be gain confidence and be chill ! go to a table of girl and a few dude I never talk to during lunch , I ask if they want to play uno , and we get to play .

I start think and it be something I realize be that every guy I 've meet who have drug addiction problem never have an issue with woman . I mean , he be not always date the hot woman on the planet but he never have issue find someone . sure , he can not keep a job , he be bounce off the wall at home but find love be never ever a problem for he . meanwhile , a lot of guy I work with who be very button down , disclipline and healthy , they be very anti - drug , hard working , ex - military type man in their late 's 's , show up to work every day on time and will stay back if ask , they be all * * alone * * . they live alone in their small apartment . some of they have plan to fly overseas to find a partner so they definitely want someone but they seem to struggle find a woman locally . why be it that man who live healthy , disclplined lifestyle , always walk the straight and narrow struggle with woman while guy who be drug addict mess always have a partner ? irrespective of look .                                         \n","13   I just get back from meet up with a girl for drink tonight . she be nice and we hang out for minute or so , she be laugh and from my perspective the vibe be good . then all of a sudden her friend run into she in the bar .

Earlier I went and cold approached a pretty woman who was sitting at a bench waiting for her friend, asked if she'd mind if I sat next to her and she said no, so I sat and started talking to her, and we had a good conversation going on! After minutes of talking, I had to leave, so I left, and didn't bother asking for her number or anything, despite the IOI's I got, I just didn't feel like asking for it.. Mainly because that was prob the only time we'd meet, anyways. During that whole thing, my heart wasn't racing, I was relaxed, and I was interested in engaging in a convo with her.. At that moment, it was like I broke through the bottleneck I been stuck on, which was gaining confidence and being chill! Went to a table of girls and a few dudes I never talked to during lunch, I asked if they wanted to play uno, and we got to playing. I engaged with all of them, made fun of them in a playful way during the game, and got their instas and dabbed them up, all without me overthinking or having second thoughts, if anything I was eager to play and get to know all of them! All throughout today, I was able to have convos with a lot of girls/guys while putting the knowledge from this seddit and other sources into play, checking for IOI's, dabbing them up and seeing how long they hold my hand for, all while staying relaxed.
